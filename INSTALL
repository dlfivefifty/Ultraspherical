To run the C++ implementation of adaptive QR for the ultraspherical spectral method, first compile the source:

	cd Ultraspherical
	c++ main.cpp MultiplicationMatrices.cpp AdaptiveQR.cpp FilledBandedMatrix.cpp -o ultraspherical


Calling 

	./ultraspherical 1 2 1.1 3 4

will print out the Chebyshev coefficients of the solution to

	u'' + (1.1*T_0(x) + 3*T_1(x) + 4*T_2(x)) u = 0,	u(-1) = 1,	u(1) = 2
