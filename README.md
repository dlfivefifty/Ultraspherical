Ultraspherical
==============

Implements ultraspherical spectral methods for solving linear ODEs. 
This method results in matrices which are almost banded and a solver
requires O(n) operations.


The package contains a C++, Matlab and Mathematica implementation. All implementations are experimental.

The Matlab implementation requires chebfun:

The Mathematica implementation requires RHPackage:
